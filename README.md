# PicoTempLED

Trying to figure out the trigger temperature:

CPU throttles at 85C, the LAN at 70C

So safer option is the 70C internal temp

Pis tend to run 20C to 30C above room temp.

So the safest operating temperature is 40C

Compare room Pico against Pi internal temp

Set light to blink when temperature of Pi triggers fan.
